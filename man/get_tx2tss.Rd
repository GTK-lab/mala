\title{Get a mapping of transcripts to transcription start sites.}
\usage{
get_tx2tss(
  threshold = 500,
 
    annotation_gtf_file = "http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.100.gtf.gz"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{If two transcripts are within \code{threshold} nucleotides
of each other, they are grouped as having the same transcription start sites.}

\item{annotation_gtf_file}{File path or URL to a GTF annotation file in the
style of ENSEMBL.}
}
\value{
tibble with two columns: \code{target_id} which contains ENST
transcript accessions, and \code{tss_id} which is a unique ID string for
each trascription start site (TSS). \code{tss_id} is a comma separated
string with chromosome name, start of TSS window, end of TSS window, and
strand (\code{"+"} or \code{"-"}). Note that \code{start <= end} regardless
of strand.

This tibble can be used as \code{sleuth_prep}'s \code{target_mapping}. Just
remebmer to set \code{aggregation_column = "tss_id"}!
